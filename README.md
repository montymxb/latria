# latria
A compact, cross platform, embeddable language with an emphasis on multi-language communication and lightweight scripting<br/><br/>

<h2>about.</h2>

latria was born out a desire to understand language.

As scripters or programmers we wrestle everyday to communicate with machines all around us. Our ability to harness a computer is directly linked to how well we can communicate with it.

Generally this leads to a desire for shorter, more succinct statements that convey intention with unmistakable clarity.

Latria leverages a high level programming design to maximize verbosity without increasing workload. 


<h2>cross lang.</h2>

Bridge the language barrier, use all your &lt;code/&gt;

Traditionally, one would pick a particular language and stay with it, exclusively.

Over time our preferences change and we learn which languages may be best suited for certain tasks in our mind.

Like any developer you most likely have various scripts and programs written for various tasks, in various languages.

Latria can mediate quite nicely, allowing you to now only run various system level commands and collect their results in one fell swoop.

Bring back your code! Latria can handle the output itself or pipe it into another program, bringing your various libraries new purpose in your projects, no need to rewrite your old code base for a small project.

<h2>open source goodness.</h2>

Latria is written in ANSI C, and is licensed under the MIT open source license. Feel free to part it out, improve on it, or implement it in your systems. This is an early build, and is still being actively built.

If you have suggestions or improvements you may submit a pull request to have a feature or bug fix integrated into the language.

Additionally I will make documentation available at <a href="http://latria.uphouseworks.com">latria.uphouseworks.com</a>, allowing anyone to get started with latria scripting.
