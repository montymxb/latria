### Contributing to Latria.

Contributions are always welcome. Please make sure to follow a few rules however.

### Rules

* Your code must be cross platform compatible
* Your code must be reasonably compact
* Your code must pass all tests (the current CI tests will check mac, linux and windows builds of your code)

### Guidelines
 
* For bug fixes you may just submit a pull request. Include a summary of the bug and a brief overview of what you did to fix it.
* For features please open up an issue and start a discussion to have the feature integrated.
* If you patch a bug or add a feature write new test cases to cover it, if not you may be requested to do so

### Conduct

This project is open to all skill levels and backgrounds. Whether or not you've had experience in C is irrelevant. If you can constructively discuss with the community on how to help improve latria your input is welcome. Features can be implemented by others who are willing or by yourself.
